v0.2.1
    * All "-ex" suffixes were substituted by "*" suffixes.
        (i.e. LOAD-LIBRARY-EX was renamed LOAD-LIBRARY* and so on)
        This makes names more lispy.

v0.2.0
    * UUID, CLSID, FMTID and IID types have been redefined as and aliases for
        GUID. Also, removed all related stuff, such as their accessors and so
        on. Use GUID stuff
    * CLSID and IID symbols now belong to DOORS.COM package
    * Names of external functions were lispified even more:
        ** Every function name that has a "Get" prefix is translated by
            removing that prefix
        ** Every function name that has a "Set" prefix is translated by
            removing that prefix and forming a (SETF name) function name
        ** For every function which name has a "Get" or "Set" prefix and which
            either has no parameters at all or all parameters of which are
            either optional or keyword there is also a corresponding
            symbol macro.
        ** Every function name that has a "Query" prefix and for which there
            exists a corresponding setter (a function which name begins with
            "Set") is translated as a name that has a "Get" prefix.
        Example: "GetConsoleMode" ==> CONSOLE-MODE
                 "SetConsoleMode" ==> (SETF CONSOLE-MODE)
                    + CONSOLE-MODE symbol macro
    * Most enums were converted to Virgil's strongly typed enums
    * Security stuff has been moved from #:DOORS package into #:DOORS.SECURITY
        package
    * Added "pascal string" type
    * Added more system stuff(handle, process and dll stuff)

        READ-CONSOLE-INPUT functions

v0.0.3
